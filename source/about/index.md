### Full-Stack Engineer with more than 8 years of experience. ###

Forged by my history of full-stack web development, data analytics, and
interactive AR/VR/XR experiences. My last project? Developing a client's
real-time data analytics application for large-scale (n >= 1 billion)
time-series datasets using Laravel/PHP, Vue/TypeScript, MySQL, Redis, and
Docker/Kubernetes. Responsible for API design with integration between
containerized frontend and backend services.

### I'm used to delicate work **where every detail matters** and quick deliveries are a *must*. ###

As a data scientist with a background as a full-stack engineer and game
developer, I have a breadth of actionable experience prototyping rich media and
MVC web applications (React, Vue, Node, ASP.NET), composing containerized
environments (Docker), administering databases (MySQL, MongoDB), programming
computer graphics pipelines (HLSL/GLSL/Cg), and working with distributed systems
(Apache Hadoop, Redis). I have extensive experience using C# (Unity3D and
ASP.NET SPAs), JavaScript (NodeJS servers, dynamic frontends), Python (machine
learning, tool automation), R (statistics, data analytics), and C++ (custom
rendering engine work).
