# The Way It Goes #

I recently read [25 years of coding, and I'm just beginning](https://dev.to/dechamp/25-years-of-coding-and-im-just-beginning-442n) by dev.to user DeChamp, and found some intriguing responses across the web. One particular [Re:](https://www.pskirko.com/2019/01/20/re-25-years-of-coding/) came from [Peter Skirko](https://www.pskirko.com/). Rather than read back the very relatable thoughts and ideas they both covered, as pertains to development, I thought I'd begin with it to share where my mental state has recently turned to.

## The Next Steps ##

I chose to use the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) to {% post_link hello-world "build my website" %} because it should be quick, painless, and easy to write posts and get them published to the live site. This post, in some ways, is a test of that. That brings me to figuring out the next steps for my blog. While I want to add much, much more in terms of a portfolio, at the time of making this post, this site is half-baked. I'm afraid that if someone comes onto the website in its current state, it'll reflect poorly on my own work. *But, maybe that's the motivation I've been looking for.*

**I think that it's time to keep working.** By that, I mean I need to cover up the potholes and make sure that I finish what I start - all before I add more features. This means cleaning up broken links and adding little bits at a time. Keeping the momentum in building this living site will ensure that I learn more about the Hexo static-site generator as time goes on. Maybe, I'll contribute additional resources to the generator's documentation wherever I can!

## Roadmap ##

- Clean up any missing links/pages/sections. (This will require getting acquainted with some of Hexo's features).
- Add an About page.
- Learn more about the .ejs template language that came with this blog's theme!
- Customize the theme!?!?
- Read up about schema! (I'll be looking at [schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/gs.html#microdata_how).)
- Continue writing this Roadmap!
