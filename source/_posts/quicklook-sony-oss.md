# Sony's OpenColorIO #

Sony Pictures Imageworks, the visual effects and animation studio belonging to Sony, has open-sourced *[OpenColorIO](http://opencolorio.org/)*, a tool used to help create movies like the Academy-award winning *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*, *Hotel Transylvania 3*, *Alice in Wonderland*, and *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*. 

## What is this software? ##

*OpenColorIO* (OCIO) is a color management software suited for motion picture production that emphasizes visual effects and computer animation. It is compatible with the Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES), an industry-standard. 

Sony has contributed the tool to the [Academy Software Foundation](https://www.aswf.io/) (ASWF), an organization founded in August of 2018 with a focus on improving the quality of the film industry's open source software.

*OpenColorIO* is now under a modified BSD license. 

Those interested in contributing can take a look at the [developer's guide](http://opencolorio.org/developers/index.html) on their website for the system. There are also a couple of mailing lists posted for those interested in collaborating.
